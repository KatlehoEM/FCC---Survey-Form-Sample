# Cat Photo App Project

Welcome to the Cat Photo App project from freeCodeCamp! This project is part of the Responsive Web Design Certification and aims to create a simple web application for displaying cat photos.

## About the Project

The Cat Photo App project is designed to teach fundamental HTML and CSS skills necessary for building responsive web pages. In this project, you will learn how to structure HTML elements, apply CSS styles, and make the web application responsive across different devices.

## What I Learned

During the Cat Photo App project, I learned the following:

1. **HTML Basics**: I learned how to use HTML tags to create the structure of the web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and lists.

2. **HTML Forms**: I learned how to create HTML forms to collect user input, such as text input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons.

3. **CSS Styling**: I learned how to use CSS to style HTML elements, including changing colors, fonts, margins, paddings, borders, and backgrounds.

4. **Responsive Design**: I learned how to make the web application responsive by using CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styling based on the device's screen size.

5. **Accessibility**: I learned the importance of accessibility in web design and how to improve accessibility by using semantic HTML elements, alt attributes for images, and proper form labels.
