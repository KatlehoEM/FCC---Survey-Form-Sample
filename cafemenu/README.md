# CafeMenu App

Welcome to CafeMenu, a simple web application for viewing cafe menu items! This project is designed to demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills by creating a dynamic menu interface for a cafe.

## About the Project

The CafeMenu app allows users to browse through various menu items offered by the cafe. Users can view categories such as drinks, pastries, sandwiches, and more. Each menu item includes details such as name and price.

## What I Learned

During the development of the CafeMenu app, I learned the following:

1. **HTML Structure**: I learned how to create the structure of a web page using HTML elements and semantic markup.

2. **CSS Styling**: I learned how to style HTML elements using CSS to improve the visual appearance of the app.

## Project Structure

The CafeMenu app consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the CafeMenu app.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the CafeMenu app.

Feel free to explore the project files to see how HTML and CSS are used to create the CafeMenu app.
