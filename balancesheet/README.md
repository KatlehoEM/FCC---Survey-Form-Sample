# Balance Sheet Project

Welcome to the Balance Sheet project! In this project, you'll learn how to use CSS pseudo selectors to build a balance sheet. You'll explore how to change the style of specific HTML elements using pseudo selectors, such as :hover, to create interactive and visually appealing webpages.

## About the Project

The Balance Sheet project aims to create a digital representation of a balance sheet using HTML and CSS. This project will focus on using CSS pseudo selectors to enhance the interactivity and visual presentation of the balance sheet. Users will be able to hover over specific elements to trigger style changes and other events on the webpage.
